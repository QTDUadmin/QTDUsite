The conference will likely be held at [308 Queen Street](https://about.uq.edu.au/campuses-facilities/brisbane-city/308-queen-st), in Brisbane's city centre. This will be confirmed soon.
The venue is within walking distance of Central train station, Riverside ferry terminal, and the main bus route hubs for Brisbane -- Queen Street and King George Square.
