## Directions

<b>From Brisbane airport to city centre:</b> Brisbane's international and domestic airports are directly connected to the city centre by train. When departing the airport, look for signs pointing to the AirTrain station. Trains depart approximately every 20min, and tickets cost around $20 one way. Central is the train station closest to the conference venue. The journey takes about half an hour.

Note: AirTrain services do not run very early and very late in the day. Please check the [Translink website](https://translink.com.au/) in case you'd like to consider this when booking flights. Otherwise, there are taxi ranks at both airports, and rideshare services.

<b>From Gold Coast airport to city centre:</b> You will first need to take a connecting bus, Route 760, from the Gold Coast airport to Varsity Lakes train station, then take the Airport line train to Brisbane. Central is the train station closest to the conference venue. Note that this journey takes about 2 hours.

## About Brisbane

### Public Transport

For infomation about Brisbane's public transport networks, visit the [Translink website](https://translink.com.au/). If you are planning to use public transport while you're here, we recommend purchasing a GoCard.

Note that services are less frequent on weekends, particularly Sundays.
  
### Climate

Early November is the edge of summer in Brisbane. Temperatures range around 26-30°C in daytime, sometimes into the low 30s. Overnight temperatures tend to be around 18°C. As we are close to the tropics, it can be quite humid and there may be storms. 
Air-conditioning indoors can be quite cold, so you might like to bring a jumper nonetheless.

As the sun is a deadly laser, we recommend keeping an eye on the [UV index](http://www.bom.gov.au/uv/) while you're here, and using sunscreen and appropriate clothing, particularly in the middle of the day.
  
### Things to See and Do

From the centre of the city, it is a quick walk (or ferry) across the river to the cultural precinct of Southbank, which includes museums and art galleries, restaurants, and a public artificial beach. The next suburb over, West End, also has a variety of restaurants and cafes.

For natural beaches, one can travel north to the Sunshine Coast, or south to the Gold Coast, or east to Stradbroke Island (however note these are definitely day trips!). 

Mt Coot-tha overlooks the city, and can be reached by bus. The Brisbane Planetarium and Mt Coot-tha botanic gardens are also nestled into the side of the mountain.

### Visiting the University of Queensland

If you'd like to visit the University of Queensland campus, and the [School of Mathematics and Physics](https://smp.uq.edu.au/), we are located in the suburb of St Lucia, about half an hour by bus from the city centre (or slightly longer but more scenically by ferry).

If you are considering extending your stay either side of the conference, and would like to get in touch with anyone in the School, please let us know!
