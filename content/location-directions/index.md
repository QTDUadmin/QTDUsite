The conference will be held in Room 1M16 at [308 Queen Street](https://about.uq.edu.au/campuses-facilities/brisbane-city/308-queen-st), in Brisbane's city centre.

The venue is within walking distance of Central train station, Riverside ferry terminal, and the main bus route hubs for Brisbane: Queen Street and King George Square. 

## Directions

<b>From Brisbane airport to city centre:</b> Brisbane's international and domestic airports are directly connected to the city centre by a train line. When departing the airport, look for signs pointing to the AirTrain station. Trains depart approximately every 20min, and tickets cost around $20 one way. Central is the train station closest to the conference venue. The journey takes about half an hour.

Note: AirTrain services will not be available for very early and very late travel. Please check the [Translink website](https://translink.com.au/) and consider this when choosing flights.

<b>From Gold Coast airport to city centre:</b> Trains run from the Gold Coast to Brisbane city, however you will first need to take a connecting bus, Route 760, from the Gold Coast airport to Varsity Lakes train station, then take the Airport line train to Brisbane. Central is the train station closest to the conference venue.

Note: This journey takes about 2 hours.

## Public Transport

For infomation about Brisbane's public transport networks, visit the [Translink website](https://translink.com.au/). If you are planning to do a bit of traveling on public transport while you're here, we recommend purchasing a GoCard.

Note that services are less frequent on weekends, particularly Sundays.
  
## Climate

Early November is the edge of summer in Brisbane. Temperatures range around 26-30 °C during the day, but can go further into the low 30s. Overnight temperatures tend to be around 18 °C. As we are close to the tropics, it can be quite humid and there may be storms. 

As the sun is a deadly laser, we recommend keeping an eye on the [UV index](http://www.bom.gov.au/uv/) while you're here, and using sunscreen and appropriate clothing.
