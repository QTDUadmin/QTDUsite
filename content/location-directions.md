The conference will be held in Room 1M16 at [308 Queen Street](https://about.uq.edu.au/campuses-facilities/brisbane-city/308-queen-st), in Brisbane's city centre.

The venue is within walking distance of Central train station, Riverside ferry terminal, and the main bus route hubs for Brisbane: Queen Street and King George Square. 

## Directions

From Airport to city centre: Brisbane's international and domestic airports are directly connected to the city centre by a train line. When departing the airport, look for signs pointing to the AirTrain station. Trains depart approximately every 20min, and tickets cost around $20 one way. Central is the station closest to the conference venue.

## Public Transport

For infomation about Brisbane's public transport networks, visit the [Translink website](https://translink.com.au/). If you are planning to do a bit of traveling on public transport while you're here, we recommend purchasing a GoCard.
  
## Climate

Early November is the edge of summer in Brisbane. Temperatures range around 26-30 °C during the day, but can go further into the low 30s. Overnight temperatures tend to be around 18 °C. As we are close to the tropics, it can be quite humid and there may be storms. 
As the sun is a deadly laser, we recommend keeping an eye on the [UV index](http://www.bom.gov.au/uv/) while you're here, and using sunscreen and appropriate clothing.
