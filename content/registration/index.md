Registration is currently open, and will close on the 18th of October, or when we reach venue capacity. If you have been accepted for a talk, we encourage you to register as soon as possible to secure your place. 

This year we are offering some different options for fees, as well as a separate ticket for the conference dinner. The dinner will be held on Wednesday 13th November, at <a href="https://www.riverbarandkitchen.com.au/">River Bar & Kitchen</a>.
