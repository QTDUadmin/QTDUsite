We will be accepting registrations here from July 10th 2023, after abstracts have been reviewed. Numbers are limited so priority for registration will be given to those presenting a talk. 
There will be a small conference fee of $90 (AUD), with support for registrants with limited funding to be made available.
More information will appear on this page closer to the registration opening date.
