Following the success of last year's inaugural conference, QTDU2024 is back for a 2nd iteration of our 4-day in-person conference situated in Brisbane, Australia. 
It's an opportunity for researchers in quantum thermodynamics within Australia and our region of the globe to share our work, foster new collaborations with fellow researchers both local and international, and reinforce connections made at last year's event.

Watch this space where we will announce our invited speakers, and scroll down for upcoming important dates and information about the location and organising committee.

Please visit our \[About page]({{<ref "about">}}) for more information about the goals of the conference.

<!-- and the \\[Location page]({{<ref "location-accommodation">}}) for information about the venue/Brisbane and accommodation options. The preliminary conference programme is now available \\[here]({{<ref "programme">}}). #Abstract submissions and registration are now closed. -->

We look forward to seeing you in Brisbane!
