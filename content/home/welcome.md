Quantum Thermodynamics Down Under (QTDU) will be back for 2024!

QTDU2024 will be a 4-day in-person conference situated in Brisbane, Australia, and an opportunity for all of us to share our research, foster collaborations with fellow researchers in quantum thermodynamics within Australia and our region of the globe, and reinforce connections made at last year's inaugural event.

Watch this space where we will announce our invited speakers, location, and important dates in the coming weeks.

Please visit our [About page]({{<ref "about">}}) for more information about the conference.
#and the [Location page]({{<ref "location-accommodation">}}) for information about the venue/Brisbane and accommodation options. The preliminary conference programme is now available [here]({{<ref "programme">}}).

#Abstract submissions and registration are now closed. 

We look forward to seeing you in Brisbane!
