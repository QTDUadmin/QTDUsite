Following the success of last year's inaugural conference, QTDU2024 is back for a 2nd iteration! QTDU is a 4-day in-person conference situated in Brisbane, Australia. 
It's an opportunity for researchers in quantum thermodynamics within Australia and our region of the globe to share our work, foster new collaborations with fellow researchers both local and international, and reinforce connections made at last year's event.
