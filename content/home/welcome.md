Welcome to the inaugural Quantum Thermodynamics Down Under (QTDU) conference!

How do notions of heat and irreversibility emerge from unitary microscopic dynamics? Can distinct quantum features such as entanglement or coherence improve heat engine operation? Can a fundamental understanding of thermodynamics at the quantum scale inspire new technologies, or help improve existing technologies? These are all important questions in the emerging field Quantum Thermodynamics.

We invite you to attend a 4-day conference on Quantum Thermodynamics covering four themes:

1.	Fundamental questions in quantum thermodynamics.
2.	Benefit and applications of quantum thermal machines.
3.	Connections between quantum thermodynamics and other fields, such as quantum information and quantum biology.
4.	How can quantum thermodynamics be incorporated into outreach events?

QTDU will be an opportunity for all of us to share our research and foster collaborations with fellow researchers in quantum thermodynamics. We hope that QTDU will provide the foundation for a cohesive quantum thermodynamics community in Australia.
